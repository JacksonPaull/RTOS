Bug:
There is a heisenbug when activating switch tasks. It happens very infrequently,
almost undoutedly related to the scheduling process

Features need to add:
ensure interpreter works with real main
enable code to dump time interrupts are disabled/enabled
add compile time switch for debugging tools
