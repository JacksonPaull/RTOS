File System:
- Move the read/write locks to the iNode itself.
	- Require files to reopen themselves when they read or write
- Move bitmap to its own file
	- give mutex
	- give mutex to priority queues as well (at least the one for the filesystem)

Path Parsing
	- directory (file) opening / closing
	- directory lookup

File Creation
	- dir creation

File Deletion

File Writing
	- file growth
	- (file shrinkage)

Interpreter Commands
	- mk
	- mkdir
	- rm
	- rmdir
	- cat
	- cd
	- pwd
	- ls

Bug:
	- Using O1 optimizer optimizes something out of the UART FIFOs, and causes hard faults sometimes

Done (needs debugging):
	Testing BW
	Initialization
	Opening iNodes
	Basic 1 block bitmap allocation
